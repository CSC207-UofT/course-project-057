## CSC207 Group057 Project

This project is a game program that consists of two game modes: matching game and pattern game. Player can register an account and log in, or play as a guest. Each game mode has three difficulties and themes for the player to choose from. 

**Game Rules**
Matching Rules:
1. Your aim is to uncover every pair of tiles. Each tile in the game has another matching tile.
2. Uncover a tile by clicking on it.
3. Then, press another tile.
4. If the two tiles look the same, you have found a pair!
5. If the two tiles are not the same, they will flip back over and you can try again by flipping another tile.
6. The game ends when all tiles have been uncovered. 

Pattern Rules:
1. Your aim is to copy the pattern shown on screen.
2. One tile will uncover. Remember this tile!
3. Press the same tile that was just shown to you!
4. Another tile will flip.
5. Press the tile shown in step 2, followed by the tile in step 4.
6. The next tile will flip. Repeat the process above.
7. Note that every time a new tile is shown you will need to start your move from the first tile. 
8. Keep repeating the same pattern if you can remember!
