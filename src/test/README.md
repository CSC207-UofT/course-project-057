This is a README.md file that explain the test files.

BoardManagerTest.java tests for game logic methods like flipTile() and allFlipped().

DifficultyStrategyTest.java tests for the generation of boards. There is a total of three test methods, each one for one difficulty (EasyPatternBoardTest(), MediumMatchingBoardTest(), HardMatchingBoardTest()).

UserTest.java tests for user log-in and registration logic in SQL database.

MatchingGameHistoryTest.java tests if the game statistics can be succesfully added to the game history table. The code logic is the same for PatternGame.
